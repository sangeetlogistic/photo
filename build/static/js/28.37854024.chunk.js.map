Please see the “What Information We Collect” section in our Privacy Policy for more information about the\n        types of personal information we collect. BUSINESS OR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE FOR COLLECTING, SHARING AND SELLING INFORMATION. We collect and share\n        your personal information for the following business and commercial purposes: to authenticate you when you use our websites, to provide\n        customer support, to audit our products and services, to detect security incidents, to debug and fix errors associated with our websites,\n        research, activities to maintain the quality of our websites and products and services, to encourage and enable purchases such as through our\n        various promotions, to provide personalized marketing offers and programs, to enroll you in our newsletter subscription program, and other\n        commercial transactions that occur from time to time. We do not make your data publicly available, we do not act as data brokers and we do not\n        trade in your data. However, certain standard generally accepted business practices may be deemed as “Sale” of data under the CCPA, such as\n        when we utilize third-party service providers that provide us with services while they retain certain rights to use your data for their own\n        business needs (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook, fraud detection services, our online marketing service providers, etc.). If you are a\n        California customer, you have a right under the new definition of “sale”, to request to opt-out of certain data transfers and sharing of\n        personal activities which we operate. Please refer to section 3 – “Your California Consumer Rights” below, for information on how you can\n        exercise your rights. For more details on how and to whom we share your data please refer to “Sharing your personal information” in our\n        Privacy Policy and to our Cookies Policy . YOUR CALIFORNIA CONSUMER RIGHTS. California consumers have the right to request access to the\n        specific pieces of personal information we have collected about them in the last 12 months. You may make this request up to two times in 12\n        months. You may also request additional details about our information practices, including the categories of personal information we have\n        collected about you, the categories of sources of such collection, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal\n        information, the categories of third parties with whom we share and sell your personal information, the categories of personal information we\n        have disclosed and “sold” about you in the preceding 12 months, and the categories of third parties to whom we sold personal information in\n        the preceding 12 months. If you are a California consumer, you also have the right to request deletion of your personal information (subject\n        to certain exceptions), to opt-out of sales of personal information and to receive equal service and price and not be discriminated against\n        even if you exercise any of your CCPA rights (unless permitted by applicable law, such as if the differences are reasonably related to your\n        information). Our websites do not sell (as “sell” is traditionally defined) your personal information. That is, we don’t provide your name,\n        phone number, address, email address or other personally identifiable information to third parties in exchange for money. However, under\n        California Privacy Notice, sharing information for advertising purposes may be considered a “sale” of “personal information.” Therefore, if\n        you’ve visited our digital properties within the past 12 months, under the CCPA, personal information about you may have been “sold” to our\n        advertising or other partners for their own use. California residents have the right to opt-out of the “sale” of personal information, and\n        we’ve made it easy for anyone to stop the information transfers that might be considered such a “sale” from our website or mobile app.\n        California consumers may make a rights request by submitting a respective request to info@photo2painting.com. Your request must include\n        sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal data, which may include your\n        email address and name. Additionally, California consumers may opt-out of the “sale” of information as described above by changing their\n        Privacy Preferences. Please note that by opting out of the sharing of your personal information considered as sale as defined by CCPA: You may\n        still see some tailored advertising that third parties may have previously collected unless you opt-out of all interest-based advertising (see\n        our Cookies Policy or visit www.aboutads.info/choices) We will still share your personal information with our service providers to provide the\n        services on our websites. These settings may not persist if you clear your cookies, switch devices or switch browsers. If you access our\n        websites from other browsers or devicesappliances, you will also need to select each browser and device. If you delete or clear cookies,\n        you’ll need to click the button again the next time you visit. If you delete or clear your cookies, that will delete our opt-out cookie, and\n        you will need to opt-out again. If you have previously requested that we do not sell your personal information, your request remains in effect\n        until you tell us otherwise.\n    </div>\n);\n\nexport default TermsCondition;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
